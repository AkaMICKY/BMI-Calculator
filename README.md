# 🧮 Age Calculator in C#

This is a simple console application written in **C#** that calculates your age based on your year of birth.  
It also categorizes you into different life stages (Baby, Child, Teenager, Young Adult, etc.) depending on your age.

## 🚀 Features
- Takes user input for year of birth.
- Automatically calculates your age using the current year.
- Categorizes your life stage:
  - 👶 Baby/Toddler (0–5)
  - 🧒 Child (6–12)
  - 🧑 Teenager (13–18)
  - 🧑‍💼 Young Adult (19–27)
  - 🧔 Middle Age (28–38)
  - 👴 Elder (39–55)
  - 🧓 Old Elder (56+)

## 💻 How to Run
git clone https://github.com/AkaMICKY/Age-Calculator.git

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio** or your preferred C# IDE.  
2. Build and run the program.  
3. Enter your **year of birth** when prompted.  
4. The program will display:
   - Your current age  
   - Your life stage  

## 📌 Example Output
Hello, I Calculate How Old You Are, using Your BirthDay
SO Lets get Started
When Is Your BirthDay(Year)? : 2009
You Are 16 Years Old
Hence You are a Teenager ;)

## ⚠️ Notes
- Make sure to enter a valid year (e.g., 2005).
- If you enter text or an invalid year, the program may crash.
- This will be improved later with error handling.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements
- Add error handling for invalid input.
- Extend life stages with more categories.
- Add month/day support for more accurate age calculation.
