# 🏋️ BMI Calculator  

📌 **Description**  
A simple C# console app that calculates your **Body Mass Index (BMI)** from your weight (kg) and height (m). It then tells you which category you fall into:  
⚪ Underweight  
🟢 Normal weight  
🟡 Overweight  
🔴 Obese  

This project is great practice for:  
➡️ User input  
➡️ Conditionals (if/else)  
➡️ Floating-point calculations  

⚙️ **Installation**  
1. Clone the repo with:  
   git clone https://github.com/AkaMICKY/BMI-Calculator.git  
   cd BMI-Calculator  
2. Open the project in **Visual Studio**  
3. Run it 🎉  

▶️ **Usage**  
- Enter your **weight in kg** and **height in meters** when prompted  
- The program calculates your BMI and tells you your category  

💡 Example:  
Input:  
Weight = 70  
Height = 1.75  

Output:  
Your BMI is 22.86  
You are Normal weight ✅  

🚀 **Future Improvements**  
- ✅ Add input validation with double.TryParse()  
- ✅ Allow height input in cm or ft/inches  
- ✅ Round BMI neatly with Math.Round()  
- ✅ Later expand into a GUI or web app version  

📚 **What I Learned**  
- ✍️ Capturing user input with Console.ReadLine()  
- 🔄 Converting strings to numbers using Convert.ToDouble()  
- 📏 Rounding numbers with Math.Round()  
- 🔀 Using if / else if / else to classify results
